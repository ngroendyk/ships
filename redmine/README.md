# Redmine
## Intro
Redmine is a great opensource replacement for Jira. I like it not only for software-dev but a way to keep my life organized. The one issue I had was that it was not a simple: `apt-get install redmine`. There were some peculularies with its install and setup, so I captured/fixed/documented those issues by creating a docker image it.

So, take a peak at the DockerFile for some self-documentation of the things needed to get redmine going for the given distro's/versions I use.
I'll update the README's accordingly to built the image yourself, and spin up the application in docker, on your host. Have Fun!
